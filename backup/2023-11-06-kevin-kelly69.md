假设所有跟你要账号信息的人都是潜在的诈骗犯，除非能确定他们是无辜的。确认是否无辜的方法就是用你提供而不是他们提供的号码打回去/登录。不要在电话、邮件、电邮等一切渠道中泄露身份信息。

• Money is overrated. Truly new things rarely need an abundance of money. If that was so, billionaires would have a monopoly on inventing new things, and they don’t. Instead almost all breakthroughs are made by those who lack money, because they are forced to rely on their passion, persistence and ingenuity to figure out new ways. Being poor is an advantage in innovation.

金钱被高估了。全新的事物不是大量金钱堆出来的，如果能堆出来的话，那些亿万富翁就会垄断一切发明，但是他们没有。与之相反，突破性的成果绝大部分是那些缺钱的人做到的，因为他们只能依靠自己的激情、耐心和才能。贫穷促进了创新。

为了探索你人生的价值（第二个gift，一般被翻译成天赋，但是前后文读下来我决定翻成意义），你被赋予了生命（gift of life）。当你明白你的人生到底追求着什么的时候，你就完成了这个使命。这不是悖论，生命的意义尽在于此。

• Don’t treat people as bad as they are. Treat them as good as you are.

不要用对你不友好的人的方式对待他们，善待他们。

如果你没有为你的目标准备一个日程表的话，那么它就只是你的白日梦而已。

• All the greatest gains in life — in wealth, relationships, or knowledge —come from the magic of compounding interest — amplifying small steady gains. All you need for abundance is to keep adding 1% more than you subtract on a regular basis.

生活中所有的所得，包括财富、家庭、知识，都是调和兴趣所在的魔法——比如叠加微小的收获。你所要做的，就是比你日常不断放弃的，多坚持1%。

• To succeed, get other people to pay you; to become wealthy, help other people to succeed.

想要成功，让别人给你付钱；想要富有，帮助别人成功。

• Children totally accept — and crave — family rules. “In our family we have a rule for X” is the only excuse a parent needs for setting a family policy. In fact, “I have a rule for X” is the only excuse you need for your own personal policies.

子女会认可并且渴望接受家庭规章。“咱们家里的规矩是”是父母在定规矩时唯一的理由。实际上，对你个人而言，你只需要“我有个规矩”
